# Q: Why am I getting the message "This command is disabled on this server"?
A: This message will appear if the bot has been invited without administrative permissions. Using the normal invite link, this shouldn't happen, but using a customized link can mess it up. To re-enable those commands for the server, simply reinvite the bot with administrative permissions.
